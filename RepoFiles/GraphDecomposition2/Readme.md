# Graph Decomposition 2

## Directed Graphs

A **directed graph** is a graph where each edge has a start vertex and an end vertex.

Examples:

- Streets with one-way roads.
- Links between webpages.
- Followers on social network

### Directed DFS

Can still run DFS in directed graphs.

- Only follow directed edges.
- explore(v) finds all vertices reachable from v.
- Can still compute pre- and postorderings

## Event Ordering

Linear Ordering

We would like to order tasks to respect dependencies as below.
