## Introduction, Direct Addressing and Chaining

Suppose we need a data structure that associate at each ipv4 address a counter.

For fast access we can use an **array**, so we need to convert the number in the figure in decimal form:

<img src="https://github.com/KiraDiShira/AlgorithmsAndDataStructures/blob/master/RepoFiles/Hash/Images/h1.PNG" />

In the general case, we need  `O(N) ` memory, where  `N ` is the size of our universe. Universe is the set of all objects, that we might possibly want to store in our data structure. It doesn't mean that every one of them will be stored in our data structure. But if we at least at some point might want to store it, we have to count it. So for example, if some of the IP addresses never access your service. You will still have to have a cell in your array for this particular IP, in the direct addressing method. So, this method only works when the universe is somewhat small. And we need to invent something else to work with the universes which are bigger than that or even infinite. Such as, for example, the universe of all possible words, all possible strings, or all possible files on your computer.

What if we use a **list**?

**Hash funcion**

If we have for example 25 object in the universe and m is only 10, then at least two objects will have the same code from 0 to 9 because there are only 10 different codes and there are 25 different objects. So that won't work for all possible universes and for small m. 

In this situation, when the values of the hash function are the same, but the objects which are being encoded are different, is called a **collision**. So collisions cause us problems. Because of collisions, we cannot just directly apply the scheme called direct addressing with O(m) memory.

Let's define a **map**:

<img src="https://github.com/KiraDiShira/AlgorithmsAndDataStructures/blob/master/RepoFiles/Hash/Images/h7.PNG" />

We want to implement a map, using hash function, and some combination of ideas from direct addressing, and least based solution from one of the previous videos. So what we'll do is called **chaining**. We will create an array of size m, where m is the cardinality of the hash function, and in this case, let m be eight. This won't be an array of integers, though. This will be an array of lists. So in each cell of this array, we will store a list. And this will be a list of pairs. And each pair will consist of an object, O. And a value V, corresponding to this object. Let's look at an example.

Now let's look at asymptotics of chaining schema:

 We've introduced the notion of map, and now we'll introduce a very similar and natural notion of a **set**.

**What is a hash table?** A hash table is any implementation of a set or a map which is using hashing, hash functions. It can even not use chaining. There are different ways to use hash functions to store a set or a map in memory. But chaining is one of the most frequently used methods to implement a hash table. 

Hash table examples:

## Hash functions

You want to design a data structure to store your contacts: names of people along with their phone numbers. The data structure should
be able to do the following quickly:

- Add and delete contacts,
- Lookup the phone number by name,
- Determine who is calling given their phone number.

We need two Maps: (phone number ‚Üí name) and (name ‚Üí phone number)

Implement these Maps as hash tables. First, we will focus on the Map from phone numbers to names.

If we choose the **direct addressing** way:

- int(123-45-67) = 1234567
- Create array Name of size 10^L where L is the maximum allowed phone number length
- Store the name corresponding to phone number P in Name[int(P)]
- If no contact with phone number P, Name[int(P)] = N/A

<img src="https://github.com/KiraDiShira/AlgorithmsAndDataStructures/blob/master/RepoFiles/Hash/Images/h20.PNG" />

Whis this implementation:

- Operations run in O(1)
- Memory usage: O(10L), where L is the maximum length of a phone number
- Problematic with international numbers of length 12 and more: we will need 1012 bytes = 1TB to store one person's phone book - this won't fit in anyone's phone!

**A better schema is chaining.**

<img src="https://github.com/KiraDiShira/AlgorithmsAndDataStructures/blob/master/RepoFiles/Hash/Images/h21.PNG" />

Parameters:

- **n**: phone numbers stored
- **m**: cardinality of the hash function
- **c**: length of the longest chain
- **O(n + m)** memory is used
- **ùõº = n/m**: is called **load factor**
- Operations run in time O(c + 1)
- You want small m and c!

Good example:

<img src="https://github.com/KiraDiShira/AlgorithmsAndDataStructures/blob/master/RepoFiles/Hash/Images/h22.PNG" />

Bad example:

<img src="https://github.com/KiraDiShira/AlgorithmsAndDataStructures/blob/master/RepoFiles/Hash/Images/h23.PNG" />

For the map from phone numbers to names, select **m = 1000**

I need to choose an hash function, for example: take first three digits
- h(800-123-45-67) = 800
- Problem: area code
- * h(425-234-55-67) =
  * h(425-123-45-67) =
  * h(425-223-23-23) = ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ = 425

If I choose as hash function: take last three digits
- h(800-123-45-67) = 567
- Problem if many phone numbers end with three zeros

If i chosse a random value as hash function: random number between 0 and 999
- Uniform distribution of hash values
- Different value when hash function called again -> we won't be able to find anything!
- Hash function must be deterministic

Good hash functions are:

- Deterministic
- Fast to compute
- Distributes keys well into dierent cells
- Few collisions
