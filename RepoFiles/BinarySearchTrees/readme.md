## Introduction

- Find all words that start with some given string
- Find all emails received in a given period.
- Find the person in your class whose height is closest to yours

All of these are example of **local search problems**:

A **Local Search Datastructure** stores a number of elements each with a key coming from an ordered set. It supports operations:

- **RangeSearch(x, y)**: Returns all elements with keys between x and y.
- **NearestNeighbors(z)**: Returns the element with keys on either side of z
